  "summary": "Diffusion models suffer from slow sample generation at inference time. Despite recent efforts, improving the sampling efficiency of stochastic samplers for diffusion models remains a promising direction. We propose Splitting Integrators for fast stochastic sampling in pre-trained diffusion models in augmented spaces. Commonly used in molecular dynamics, splitting-based integrators attempt to improve sampling efficiency by cleverly alternating between numerical updates involving the data, auxiliary, or noise variables. However, we show that a naive application of splitting integrators is sub-optimal for fast sampling. Consequently, we propose several principled modifications to naive splitting samplers for improving sampling efficiency and denote the resulting samplers as Reduced Splitting Integrators. In the context of Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD) [Pandey \\& Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our stochastic sampler achieves an FID score of 2.36 in only 100 network function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.63 for the best baselines.",
