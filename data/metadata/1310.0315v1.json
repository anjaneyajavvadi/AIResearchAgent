  "summary": "The number of road vehicles significantly increased in recent decades. This trend accompanied a build-up of road infrastructure and development of various control systems to increase road traffic safety, road capacity and travel comfort. In traffic safety significant development has been made and today's systems more and more include cameras and computer vision methods. Cameras are used as part of the road infrastructure or in vehicles. In this paper a review on computer vision systems in vehicles from the stand point of traffic engineering is given. Safety problems of road vehicles are presented, current state of the art in-vehicle vision systems is described and open problems with future research directions are discussed.",
