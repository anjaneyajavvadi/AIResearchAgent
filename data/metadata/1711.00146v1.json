  "summary": "We propose an approach to Multitask Learning (MTL) to make deep learning models faster and lighter for applications in which multiple tasks need to be solved simultaneously, which is particularly useful in embedded, real-time systems. We develop a multitask model for both Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation and analyze the challenges that appear during its training. Our multitask network is 1.6x faster, lighter and uses less memory than deploying the single-task models in parallel. We conclude that MTL has the potential to give superior performance in exchange of a more complex training process that introduces challenges not present in single-task models.",
